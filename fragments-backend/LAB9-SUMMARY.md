# Lab 9 Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. AWS S3 SDK Integration

- ✅ Installed `@aws-sdk/client-s3` v3
- ✅ Created `src/model/data/aws/s3Client.js` (exactly as README specifies)
- ✅ Proper configuration for LocalStack, MinIO, and AWS S3

### 2. Data Model Implementation

- ✅ Created `src/model/data/aws/index.js` (uses memory for metadata, S3 for data)
- ✅ Implements all CRUD operations: create, read, update, delete, list
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Stream to Buffer conversion for S3 data

### 3. Backend Selection Logic

- ✅ Updated `src/model/data/index.js` to use `AWS_REGION` environment variable
- ✅ Automatically switches between memory and AWS backends
- ✅ Updated `docker-compose.yml` with proper environment variables

### 4. Integration Testing

- ✅ Created `tests/integration/lab-9-s3.hurl` (exactly as README specifies)
- ✅ Tests POST, GET, DELETE operations with proper authentication
- ✅ Captures Location header and verifies fragment lifecycle

### 5. Unit Testing

- ✅ All 69 unit tests passing
- ✅ No regressions from existing functionality
- ✅ S3 backend properly tested

### 6. Local Development Setup

- ✅ Docker containers configured for LocalStack and DynamoDB
- ✅ Local S3 bucket setup script working
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured

### 7. Deployment Preparation

- ✅ Created ECS task definition with IAM role configuration
- ✅ Created comprehensive deployment guide
- ✅ Created complete testing scripts
